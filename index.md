I am Electrical Engineer major 

## Favorite CPSC 120L labs 

Lab 1
Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs since it consisted of the start for my love of c++ and vs code. It helped me start off my true passion for coding knowing Iâ€™d have some difficulties, but I pushed through the obstacles and did my best to overcome those challenges. I also like the lab because it introduced me to C++ and Git hub, I had no idea what git hub was and now I am familiar with git hub, I know where to find the tools if needed.  

Lab 8
Lab 8 was the lab where I finally started to get the hang of coding and to the point where I started to use if and else statements. Me and my partner worked and did our part knowing we would struggle, but if we ever did, we would go to our teacher and ask for help. The main struggle I had was conducting the proper format on certain streets that was given. For example, you would have to live on a certain street at a certain time. Ash street would have no parking from 8 A.M to 12 A.M. 

Lab 12 
Lab 12 is one the new labs but knowing I may pass with a good grade makes me feel good because knowing I have never created an image before by using Magick into standard vectors. Even though it took a while because again I struggled with the formatting, so I needed to ask my teacher for help. Afterall it was my favorite lab because it made me use the entirety of my brain.
